# TODO: Make this into a data story.

# Motivation: World cup cricket 'loss'

# What was asked - what is the chances of a draw?

# In this case, chances are quite low as need both a draw after 50 AND after 51 overs.

# RPO for super over likely to be higher - maybe double?

# What about just draws?

# Then David tracked whether the 1.8% we find for draws given runrate of 4.8 is what we've seen in history

# He found it seems to change through time. Also some thoughts on whether teams are balanced. If not, rate will be lower.

# JM realised runrate assumption isn't constant through time - steadily increasing, which means draw rate decreases (variance of larger numbers is larger)

# how do we speed up the computation/simulation?
# can use sum of poisson is a poisson. Then use diff of poisson to get to bessel function.
# alternatively, could use normal approximation to poisson
# incorporate this to show teams seem to be getting more similar, but lots of uncertainty.

# how can we improve the model further? Match location? Likely runrate, so chance of draw depends on that as well as time, also relative strength
# of teams.

# overall conclusions: even with imperfect data we can often find something of interest. e.g. sometimes we can use proxies to answer questions,
# just answer won't be anywhere near precise. Lots of statistical distributions/models are related. Simplifications don't tend to matter too much
# compared to noise in data, so don't be too worried about getting model wrong, if model wrongness isn't big compared to data uncertainty?

# Lots of jumping off points: Maths for distributions, cricket information, runrate model etc.
