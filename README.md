Other ideas:

Wordle: Could do something based on letter frequency, or letter placement frequency? And then maybe "find the words with a 'T' in place 3" type thing
could be done. Also just some explanation of "which letters should you use first" type stuff?

Can we do something like 'suppose you have 4 letters in the right spot, which 4 give you the greatest number of words left?' This might be tricky to formulate - idea is to try and hit things like *ight (where * could be e,f,l,m,n,r,s,t). (Could it be done via antijoins?)
